REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL
	    
POST-INSTALL

	After installation you have to copy the grub boot imagefiles to 
	/boot/grub/:
	
	$ cp /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/* /boot/grub
	
	(Of course, you can choose another location as described above but
	this guide assumes that you use /boot/grub. Normally you need only 
	the files stage1 and stage2 - please read the grub documentation if
	you don't know why. http://www.uruk.org/orig-grub/ and
	http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html)

	Now it's time to create your own "boot menu":

	$ # Copy sample file
	$ cp /boot/grub/menu.lst.sample /boot/grub/menu.lst
	$ # Modify it for your system 
	$ vi /boot/grub/menu.lst
	
	For more information about setting up your own grub boot menu file:
	http://www.gnu.org/manual/grub-0.92/html_mono/grub.html#Configuration
	
	Last but not least - install/enable the bootmanager:
	$ # Run grub
	$ grub
	grub> install (hd0,0)/boot/grub/stage1 d (hd0) (hd0,0)/boot/grub/stage2
	[wordwrap] p (hd0,0)/boot/grub/menu.lst
	grub> quit
	
	Please correct the path & device names according your configuration.
	See also http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Installation
	
	That's all. Good luck ;)	

PRECAUTION

	Installing a new boot manager is like modifiying the partition table 
	using fdisk - or installing a new system kernel. Please create a rescue
	boot disk first :)
	This is a heavy patched version of grub - Use it on your own risk !
